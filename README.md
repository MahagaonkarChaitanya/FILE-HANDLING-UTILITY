# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS

The task performed in this assignment is the implementation of a File Handling Utility using Java. The main purpose of this task is to understand how files can be created, read, and modified using Java programming. The program uses classes from the java.io package such as FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader to perform file operations. First, data is written into a text file, then the content of the file is read and displayed on the console. After that, new data is appended to the same file without deleting the existing content. Exception handling is used to manage possible input-output errors. This task provides practical knowledge of file handling concepts used in real-world applications.
